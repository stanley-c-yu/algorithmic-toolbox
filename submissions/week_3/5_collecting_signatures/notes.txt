Inputs: 
	- segments: an array of tuples that maintain line segment coordinates that represent
		periods of time in which a resident is home.   

Steps: 
	0.  Create an empty points array. 
	1.  Sort array of tuples in ascending order. 
	2.  For each segment tuple: 
		Append the start and stop to the Points Array.  
		If start falls within the bounds of the next segment tuple, keep it, 
			otherwise, remove it from the points array.  
		If the end falls within the bounds of the next segment tuple, keep it, 
			otherwise, remove it from the points array.  
		If one of the start or end points falls within the next segment, skip it
			or remove it from the list of tuple segments. 
		Move on to the next non-covered segment.  
		Append the start and stop coordinates to the Points Array.  
		Check if they fall within the next segment tuple.  Keep the points that do, 
			remove the rest.  
		If they don't, check to see if this segment encompasses the next segment.  
		If it encompasses the next segment, move on to the next segment.  
		Repeat process, unless it's the last segment, and it isn't covered.  
			If it isn't covered, add the endpoint.
